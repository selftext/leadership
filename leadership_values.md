## My Leadership Values

What do I care about most?

Rigorous thinking. Candid speaking. In service to others.

My role as a leader is to foster these values on my team and put them into practice in my work for the company and the users it serves.

Rigorous thinking requires curiosity, skepticism, critical self-reflection, and continual learning.

Candid speaking requires humility, integrity, empathy, and the courage to speak honestly and plainly.

These values are in service to one another. Without rigorous thinking, candid speaking may be misdirected or biased. Without candid speaking, rigorous thinking may be ineffectual or uncaring.

These values are also in service to a larger cause: other people. Whether for the people on my team, in the larger organization, or the rest of the world, my ultimate goal is to put these values to work to make things better for them. I measure my success by the success of others.

Fostering these values and putting them into practice requires constant diligence. They require careful listening, where I ask more questions than I answer. They require time and energy devoted to challenging my own assumptions. And they require direct, honest communication with the courage to challenge the assumptions of others.

As a leader, I am in service to my team, the company, and its community of users. My calling is to ensure that the work we do makes a difference in the world. My promise is to support that work through rigorous thinking and candid speaking, always mindful that these are in service to those around me and the world at large.
